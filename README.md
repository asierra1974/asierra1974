- 👋 Hi, I'm @ asierra1974
- 👀 I am interested in being an excellent web developer, previously I worked as a backend programmer using Java although I do not know the language very well, 
      my intention is to master JavaScript to work in Frontend and Backend.
- 🌱 I am currently practicing frontend development using only HTML5 and CSS, I am also learning the correct JavaScript syntax to use all its features.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on projects for newbies, my intention is to be a fullstack web developer and work as a freelancer in a couple of months.
