- 👋 Hi, asierra1974 is my Github profile
- 👀 I have worked with computers from 25 years ago, holding different positions, sometimes as an application developer, as a server administrator, providing technical support at all levels, as systems coordinator, attending and solving many issues and incidents related to this area. I love to create software solutions, recently I have been preparing myself as a backend developer using javascript, nodejs, mongodb, postgresql, different frameworks and middlewares. My goal is to be a short-term fullstack developer. i love to learn myself, i'm very curious, if there are some things than i didn't know, quickly i start to investigate and practice these technologies, i can learn really fast.
- 🌱 I am currently practicing frontend development using only HTML5 and CSS, I am also learning the correct JavaScript syntax to use all its features.
- 💞️ I'm looking projects to collaborate, to gain experience like backend and front end developer, i want to be a fullstack developer and work to foreign companies.
